        <h2 class="text-xl text-center font-medium text-gray-600">1. what are the differences among the methods (Map,
            Filter, ForEach, and Find)? </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-500 text-center pb-3">

            <span class="font-medium text-green-800">Answer:</span> <br>
            
            <span class="font-semibold">.map() :</span> Transform each item in an array and output to a new array
            without altering the original array. <br>

            <span class="font-semibold">.filter() :</span> Remove items of an array based on some criteria without
            altering the original array. <br>
            <span class="font-semibold">.forEach() :</span> perform some function on each item of an array. Function
            .forEach() is another form of just a plain for
            loop that can be used to iterate through array items. This case of a function is used for more complex
            arrays,
            for example, an array of objects with a lot of entries than just an array of integers. <br>


            <span class="font-semibold">.find() :</span> Function .find() is also a search function like the previous
            but they differ in one small detail â€” this
            function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will
            return
            the first that has matched. <br>

        <h2 class="text-xl text-center font-medium text-gray-600">2. The difference among the following Storages (Local
            Storage, Session Storage, Cookies)? </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-center text-gray-500 pb-3">

            <span class="font-medium text-green-800">Answer:</span><br>

            <span class="font-semibold">Local Storage :</span> It allows 10MB of data to be stored.The stored data is
            not deleted when the browser is closed.Local storage useful for storing data that the user will need to
            access later, such as offline data.This is especially useful for storing data that you want to persist even
            if the user closes the browser, such as preferences or settings. Local Storage is a new feature introduced
            in HTML5.The data is not sent with the request from the client to the server.The data is stored on the
            browser and system.
            <br>
            <span class="font-semibold">Session Storage :</span> It allows 5MB of data to be stored. The data is stored
            only for the session and will be deleted when the browser is closed.
            Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications.Session storage is useful
            for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials. Session Storage is a new feature introduced
            in HTML5.The data is not sent with the request from the client to the server.The data is stored on the
            browser only.
            <br>
            <span class="font-semibold">Cookies :</span> The storage capacity is limited to 4KB of data.The data can be
            set to expire at a certain time. Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for
            a long time, such as session IDs.Cookies are often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user
            preferences Cookies are the oldest (HTML4) and most wellknown mechanism. The data is sent with the request
            from the client to the server. The data is stored on the browser only.

        <h2 class="text-xl text-center font-medium text-gray-600">3. What is Event Loop? How it's work? </h2>
        <p class="text-base text-center text-gray-500 pb-3">

            <span class="font-medium text-green-800">Answer:</span><br> 
            An event loop is something that pulls stuff out
            of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty. <br>
            Event loop works in a cyclic manner, where it continually checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If
            it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is
            processed.
